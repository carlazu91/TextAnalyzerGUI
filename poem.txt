Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and wearyOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore While I nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tappingAs of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber doorTis some visiter I muttered tapping at my chamber door Only this and nothing moreAh distinctly I remember it was in the bleak DecemberAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floorEagerly I wished the morrow vainly I had sought to borrowFrom my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost Lenore For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore Nameless here for evermoreAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtainThrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt beforeSo that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeatingTis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber doorThis it is and nothing morePresently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longerSir said I or Madam truly your forgiveness I imploreBut the fact is I was napping and so gently you came rappingAnd so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber doorThat I scarce was sure I heard you here I opened wide the door Darkness there and nothing moreDeep into that darkness peering long I stood there wondering fearingDoubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream beforeBut the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no tokenAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word LenoreThis I whispered and an echo murmured back the word Lenore Merely this and nothing moreBack into the chamber turning all my soul within me burningSoon again I heard a tapping something louder than beforeSurely said I surely that is something at my window latticeLet me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore Tis the wind and nothing moreOpen here I flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutterIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yoreNot the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed heBut with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door Perched and sat and nothing moreThen the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smilingBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it woreThough thy crest be shorn and shaven thou I said art sure no cravenGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Nights Plutonian shoreQuoth the Raven NevermoreMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainlyThough its answer little meaning little relevancy boreFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human beingEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber doorWith such name as NevermoreBut the Raven sitting lonely on that placid bust spoke onlyThat one word as if its soul in that one word he did outpourNothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered Till I scarcely more than muttered Other friends have flown before On the morrow he will leave me as my Hopes have flown beforeThen the bird said NevermoreStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spokenDoubtless said I what it utters is its only stock and storeCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful DisasterFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden boreOf Never nevermoreBut the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smilingStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and doorThen upon the velvet sinking I betook myself to linkingFancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore What this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yoreMeant in croaking NevermoreThis I sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressingTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms coreThis and more I sat divining with my head at ease recliningOn the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oerBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oerShe shall press ah nevermoreThen methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censerSwung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floorWretch I cried thy God hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent theeRespite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of LenoreQuaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost LenoreQuoth the Raven NevermoreProphet said I thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil Whether Tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashoreDesolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly I implore Is there is there balm in Gilead tell me tell me I imploreQuoth the Raven NevermoreProphet said I thing of evil prophet still if bird or devilBy that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore Tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant AidennIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name LenoreQuoth the Raven NevermoreBe that our sign of parting bird or fiend I shrieked upstarting Get thee back into the tempest and the Nights Plutonian shoreLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spokenLeave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my doorTake thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my doorQuoth the Raven NevermoreAnd the Raven never flitting still is sitting still is sittingOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber doorAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming
